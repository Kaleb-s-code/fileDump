Misc Notes
###########################
--> The simplist expression: Single constant or variable 
--> Do not need to name vars in methods with the prefix "my"
--> Nested loops are a good idea for printing out tables
--> Arrays are the same as "lists" in python

--> {{{{Next programming project is posted}}}}
    --> You need three nested loops to multiply matricies
    --> 

--> Need to have javadoc for every constant in class header
--> substring(7,10) is a string method that includes 7 and excludes 10
--> When dealing with input and output(files..etc): Do so in main
--> Remember casting (byte), (char) etc..

Various methods
###########################
--> charat(i): Might tell you the character referenced 
--> when dealing with char, make sure you are using single quotes ''
--> toUpperCase(): String method 
--> .length(): Tells you the length

formatting 
###########################
--> Sysout.printf("format string", parameters);
    --> %d(integer), %f(real number), %s(string) are format specifiers 
    --> Sysout.printf("x is %d and y is %d!\n", x, y); This is how you
        get the same effect as in python to format output.
    --> %3.2f, 3 would be fieldwidth, 2 would be decimal acuracy
--> String.format() works exactly the same, and you can assign it to a variable
    --> You could do Sysout(string.format()) to do the same thing as a (printf)
--> 

--> getPopulation should recieve an integer 

--> draw populatin should be passed both the integer reresenting the town and its population value
