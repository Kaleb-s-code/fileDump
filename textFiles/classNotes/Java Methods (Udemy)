    Methods

    --> When creating methods, you need to pass into the method the parameters with the data types
    --> You also need to pass the direct values into the function call by using the var name or value
    --> Once you've done this, you don't need to define the vars in the method
    --> Ref **** JavaCode\moretesting\src\main\java\com\thisisatest\App.java**** to see a good example
